# Closy - Project Documentation

## Project Overview
A React Native/Expo application for managing your wardrobe and getting daily outfit suggestions based on weather conditions and personal style preferences. This is a local-first mobile app that helps users organize their closet digitally and receive intelligent outfit recommendations based on weather, dress codes, and style rules.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: React Native with Expo SDK 53
- **Navigation**: Expo Router v5 (file-based routing)
- **Database**: SQLite (expo-sqlite) - local-only persistence
- **Image Handling**: expo-image-picker
- **Weather API**: Open-Meteo (no API key required)
- **Platform**: iOS and Android
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode enabled)

## Key Features

### Current Implementation
1. **Digital Closet**: Add garments with photos, track wear history
2. **Weather Integration**: Fetches real-time weather from Open-Meteo
3. **Rule-Based Outfit Engine**: Suggests outfits based on:
   - Temperature-appropriate clothing warmth levels
   - Dress code (casual, smart casual, business, sport)
   - Color coordination (complementary colors, neutrals)
   - Rotation to avoid recent repeats
   - Water resistance for rainy conditions
4. **Local Storage**: All data stored locally using SQLite

### Outfit Suggestion Algorithm
- **Temperature Mapping**: Maps weather to warmth requirements (1-5 scale)
- **Style Scoring**: Evaluates color harmony, neutral balance, favorites
- **Rotation Bonus**: Prioritizes less-worn items
- **Constraint Filtering**: Respects dress codes and weather requirements

## Available Scripts
```bash
npm start       # Start Expo development server
npm run ios     # Run on iOS simulator
npm run android # Run on Android emulator
npx tsc --noEmit # Type check without emitting files
```

## Database Schema
```sql
garments table:
- id: TEXT PRIMARY KEY
- type: TEXT (top|bottom|outerwear|shoe|accessory)
- name: TEXT (optional)
- colors: TEXT (JSON array)
- warmth: INTEGER (1-5)
- waterResistant: INTEGER (0|1)
- dressCodes: TEXT (JSON array)
- imageUri: TEXT
- lastWornAt: TEXT (ISO date)
- timesWorn: INTEGER
- isDirty: INTEGER (0|1)
- favorite: INTEGER (0|1)
```

## Next Steps (TODO)

### 1. Implement Wear Action
- Add `updateWear(garmentIds: string[])` function
- Increment `timesWorn` counter
- Update `lastWornAt` timestamp
- Create wear_logs table for history tracking

### 2. Enhanced Garment Tagging
- Add sheet/modal for setting garment properties on add:
  - Type selection (top, bottom, etc.)
  - Color picker or palette
  - Warmth slider (1-5)
  - Dress code multi-select

### 3. Garment Management
- Long-press GarmentCard to toggle `isDirty` status
- Edit garment properties
- Delete functionality
- Batch operations

### 4. Notifications
- Morning local notification with top outfit suggestion
- Weather-based alerts (rain expected, etc.)

### 5. Additional Features
- Multiple outfit saves/favorites
- Laundry management view
- Statistics dashboard (most/least worn)
- Packing list generator for trips
- Seasonal wardrobe switching

## Project Setup History

### Initial Creation
The project was created using Expo's TypeScript template and enhanced with the following:

1. **Project Initialization**
   ```bash
   npx create-expo-app match-wardrobe -t expo-template-blank-typescript
   npx expo install expo-router react-native-safe-area-context react-native-screens
   npx expo install expo-sqlite expo-image-picker expo-location expo-crypto
   ```

2. **Configuration Updates**
   - Added Expo Router plugin to app.json
   - Enabled typedRoutes experiment for better TypeScript support
   - Configured path aliases (~/*) in tsconfig.json for cleaner imports

3. **File Structure Creation**
   - Set up Expo Router with Stack navigation
   - Created three main screens: Today (home), Closet, and Settings
   - Implemented modular library structure for business logic

4. **Database Migration**
   - Updated from deprecated SQLite API to new sync methods
   - Changed from `openDatabase` to `openDatabaseSync`
   - Converted transaction-based queries to async methods

## Development Notes

### Path Aliases
The project uses `~/*` path alias configured in tsconfig.json, allowing imports like:
```typescript
import { getAllGarments } from "~/lib/db";
```

### Weather API
Open-Meteo provides free weather data without requiring an API key:
- Current temperature, wind speed
- Precipitation probability
- No authentication needed

### Color Matching Logic
The color module implements:
- Neutral color detection (black, white, gray, navy, etc.)
- Complementary color pairing (blue/orange, red/green, yellow/purple)
- Color family grouping for monochromatic outfits

## Implementation Details

### File Contents Summary

**app/_layout.tsx**: Root layout with Expo Router Stack navigation
- Platform-specific animations (iOS default, Android fade)
- Header shown by default

**app/index.tsx**: Today screen with outfit suggestions
- Weather display and dress code toggling
- Up to 3 outfit suggestions with photos
- Shuffle and Wear actions (Wear shows alert placeholder)
- Fallback weather data if location/API fails

**app/closet.tsx**: Garment management screen  
- Grid display of all garments (2 columns)
- Add button launches image picker
- Quick add with default properties (white top, casual, warmth 1)

**app/settings.tsx**: Placeholder settings screen

**components/GarmentCard.tsx**: Grid item component
- Image display with fallback background
- Name (or type if no name) and metadata (colors, warmth)

**lib/types.ts**: Core TypeScript definitions
- ClothingType, DressCode, Warmth enums
- Garment interface with all properties
- Weather interface

**lib/db.ts**: SQLite database layer
- Auto-creates garments table on first run
- addGarment() and getAllGarments() functions
- Uses expo-crypto for UUID generation

**lib/rules.ts**: Outfit suggestion engine
- suggestOutfits() main function with scoring algorithm
- Temperature-based clothing warmth mapping
- Style scoring (neutrals, accents, complementary colors)
- Rotation bonus for less-worn items
- Waterproof filtering for rainy weather

**lib/weather.ts**: Location and weather services
- Requests location permission
- Fetches from Open-Meteo API (free, no key needed)
- Returns temperature, wind, rain probability

**lib/color.ts**: Color matching utilities
- NEUTRALS set for basic colors
- Color family grouping (blue, orange, red, etc.)
- Complementary pair detection
- Same family checking

### Technical Decisions Made

1. **Expo SQLite API Update**: Migrated from callback-based to async/await pattern
2. **Simple Add Flow**: Quick-add garments with image picker, detailed editing for later
3. **Rule-Based Engine**: No ML, uses deterministic style rules for outfit suggestions
4. **Local-First**: All data stored locally, weather only external dependency
5. **Minimal Dependencies**: Used only required Expo modules, no UI library

### Acceptance Criteria Met
✅ TypeScript compiles without errors  
✅ Expo Router navigation working  
✅ SQLite database initialized and functional  
✅ Weather fetching with fallback  
✅ Rule-based outfit suggestions  
✅ Add garments via image picker  
✅ Grid display in closet  
✅ Dress code switching  
✅ Basic UI interactions (Wear alert, Shuffle)  

### Known Issues & Considerations
- React Native version (0.79.6) slightly newer than expected (0.79.5)
- Metro bundler cache rebuilding on first run takes time
- Location permission required for weather (falls back to defaults)
- Image picker only supports library, not camera yet
- No garment editing UI implemented yet
