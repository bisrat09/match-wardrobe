## Key Features

### Current Implementation
1. **Digital Closet**: Add garments with photos, track wear history
2. **Weather Integration**: Fetches real-time weather from Open-Meteo
3. **Rule-Based Outfit Engine**: Suggests outfits based on:
   - Temperature-appropriate clothing warmth levels
   - Dress code (casual, smart casual, business, sport)
   - Color coordination (complementary colors, neutrals)
   - Rotation to avoid recent repeats
   - Water resistance for rainy conditions
4. **Local Storage**: All data stored locally using SQLite

### Outfit Suggestion Algorithm
- **Temperature Mapping**: Maps weather to warmth requirements (1-5 scale)
- **Style Scoring**: Evaluates color harmony, neutral balance, favorites
- **Rotation Bonus**: Prioritizes less-worn items
- **Constraint Filtering**: Respects dress codes and weather requirements

## Available Scripts
```bash
npm start       # Start Expo development server
npm run ios     # Run on iOS simulator
npm run android # Run on Android emulator
npx tsc --noEmit # Type check without emitting files
```

## Database Schema
```sql
garments table:
- id: TEXT PRIMARY KEY
- type: TEXT (top|bottom|outerwear|shoe|accessory)
- name: TEXT (optional)
- colors: TEXT (JSON array)
- warmth: INTEGER (1-5)
- waterResistant: INTEGER (0|1)
- dressCodes: TEXT (JSON array)
- imageUri: TEXT
- lastWornAt: TEXT (ISO date)
- timesWorn: INTEGER
- isDirty: INTEGER (0|1)
- favorite: INTEGER (0|1)
```

## Next Steps (TODO)

### 1. Implement Wear Action
- Add `updateWear(garmentIds: string[])` function
- Increment `timesWorn` counter
- Update `lastWornAt` timestamp
- Create wear_logs table for history tracking

### 2. Enhanced Garment Tagging
- Add sheet/modal for setting garment properties on add:
  - Type selection (top, bottom, etc.)
  - Color picker or palette
  - Warmth slider (1-5)
  - Dress code multi-select

### 3. Garment Management
- Long-press GarmentCard to toggle `isDirty` status
- Edit garment properties
- Delete functionality
- Batch operations

### 4. Notifications
- Morning local notification with top outfit suggestion
- Weather-based alerts (rain expected, etc.)

### 5. Additional Features
- Multiple outfit saves/favorites
- Laundry management view
- Statistics dashboard (most/least worn)
- Packing list generator for trips
- Seasonal wardrobe switching

## Project Setup History

### Initial Creation
The project was created using Expo's TypeScript template and enhanced with the following:

1. **Project Initialization**
   ```bash
   npx create-expo-app match-wardrobe -t expo-template-blank-typescript
   npx expo install expo-router react-native-safe-area-context react-native-screens
   npx expo install expo-sqlite expo-image-picker expo-location expo-crypto
   ```

2. **Configuration Updates**
   - Added Expo Router plugin to app.json
   - Enabled typedRoutes experiment for better TypeScript support
   - Configured path aliases (~/*) in tsconfig.json for cleaner imports

3. **File Structure Creation**
   - Set up Expo Router with Stack navigation
   - Created three main screens: Today (home), Closet, and Settings
   - Implemented modular library structure for business logic

4. **Database Migration**
   - Updated from deprecated SQLite API to new sync methods
   - Changed from `openDatabase` to `openDatabaseSync`
   - Converted transaction-based queries to async methods

## Development Notes

### Path Aliases
The project uses `~/*` path alias configured in tsconfig.json, allowing imports like:
```typescript
import { getAllGarments } from "~/lib/db";
```

### Weather API
Open-Meteo provides free weather data without requiring an API key:
- Current temperature, wind speed
- Precipitation probability
- No authentication needed

### Color Matching Logic
The color module implements:
- Neutral color detection (black, white, gray, navy, etc.)
- Complementary color pairing (blue/orange, red/green, yellow/purple)
- Color family grouping for monochromatic outfits

## Implementation Details

### Technical Decisions Made

1. **Expo SQLite API Update**: Migrated from callback-based to async/await pattern
2. **Simple Add Flow**: Quick-add garments with image picker, detailed editing for later
3. **Rule-Based Engine**: No ML, uses deterministic style rules for outfit suggestions
4. **Local-First**: All data stored locally, weather only external dependency
5. **Minimal Dependencies**: Used only required Expo modules, no UI library

### Acceptance Criteria Met
✅ TypeScript compiles without errors  
✅ Expo Router navigation working  
✅ SQLite database initialized and functional  
✅ Weather fetching with fallback  
✅ Rule-based outfit suggestions  
✅ Add garments via image picker  
✅ Grid display in closet  
✅ Dress code switching  
✅ Basic UI interactions (Wear alert, Shuffle)  

### Known Issues & Considerations
- React Native version (0.79.6) slightly newer than expected (0.79.5)
- Metro bundler cache rebuilding on first run takes time
- Location permission required for weather (falls back to defaults)
- Image picker only supports library, not camera yet
- No garment editing UI implemented yet

- ✅ **EAS Update Integration**: Instant OTA updates configured for production hotfixes

## 🚨 CURRENT ISSUE: TestFlight Startup Crash

### 📋 Crash Debugging Session (September 15, 2025)

#### Problem Description:
- App launches successfully in Expo Go development
- App builds and submits to TestFlight without errors
- **Critical Issue**: App crashes immediately on launch in TestFlight
- Error message: "Closy crashed" with no additional details

#### Builds Attempted:
1. **Build #2**: Initial TestFlight submission - Crashed on launch
2. **Build #3**: Removed conflicting iOS directory - Still crashed
3. **Build #4**: Fixed database initialization patterns - Still crashed  
4. **Build #5**: Improved startup sequence and error handling - Still crashed

#### Debugging Attempts Made:

##### 1. **iOS Directory Conflict (Build #3)**
- **Theory**: Conflicting local iOS project interfering with managed workflow
- **Action**: Removed entire `ios/` directory that was created during development
- **Reason**: EAS Build warning: "ios.bundleIdentifier ignored because ios directory detected"
- **Result**: ❌ Still crashed

##### 2. **Database Initialization Issues (Build #4)**
- **Theory**: SQLite initialization at module level causing startup crash
- **Actions Taken**:
  - Converted from global `db` object to lazy `getDatabase()` function
  - Added comprehensive try/catch around database operations
  - Made database initialization happen only on first access
  - Updated all 20+ database calls to use safe pattern
- **Code Changes**: Modified `lib/db.ts` with safe initialization pattern
- **Result**: ❌ Still crashed

##### 3. **Location Permission & Startup Sequence (Build #5)**
- **Theory**: App crashing due to location permission request or blocking operations
- **Actions Taken**:
  - Moved location request to background (1-second delay)
  - Set immediate default weather to prevent blocking
  - Added graceful fallbacks for all async operations
  - Separated database loading from weather fetching
  - Added comprehensive error boundaries
- **Code Changes**: Modified `app/index.tsx` load function with:
  ```typescript
  // Set default weather immediately
  setWeather({ tempC: 20, chanceOfRain: 0.1, windKph: 8, isSnow: false });
  
  // Background location fetch with 1s delay
  setTimeout(async () => {
    try {
      const loc = await getLocationOrAsk();
      const w = await fetchWeather(loc.latitude, loc.longitude);
      setWeather(w);
    } catch (e) {
      console.log("Weather fetch failed, using defaults");
    }
  }, 1000);
  ```
- **Result**: ❌ Still crashed

#### Technical Details Investigated:
- **Build Status**: All builds completed successfully (no build-time errors)
- **TypeScript Compilation**: Clean (no errors, only SafeAreaView deprecation warnings)
- **Dependencies**: All Expo SDK 54 compatible versions
- **Permissions**: Camera, Photos, Location properly configured in app.json
- **Bundle ID**: `com.bisratbelayneh.closy` properly registered
- **Export Compliance**: Non-encryption exemption correctly set

#### What We Know:
✅ **Works in development**: Expo Go, web, and local testing all work perfectly  
✅ **Builds successfully**: EAS Build completes without errors  
✅ **Submits to TestFlight**: Upload and processing successful  
❌ **Crashes on TestFlight launch**: Immediate crash before any UI appears

#### What We Still Need:
🔍 **Actual crash logs**: Need to access real crash reports from:
  - App Store Connect → TestFlight → Crashes
  - TestFlight app feedback
  - Xcode device console logs

#### Next Steps for Resolution:
1. **Get Real Crash Logs**: Access actual stack trace and error details
2. **Minimal Test Build**: Create ultra-simple version with just "Hello World"
3. **Component Isolation**: Test individual components in isolation
4. **Native Dependencies**: Check if expo-sqlite, expo-image-picker, or expo-location causing issues
5. **Memory/Performance**: Check if app size or memory usage is the issue

#### Lessons Learned:
- TestFlight crashes can be completely different from development issues
- Without actual crash logs, debugging is mostly guesswork
- Need systematic approach: minimal → incremental feature addition
- iOS has different startup requirements than development environment

## 🚨 CRITICAL SESSION UPDATE (September 16, 2025)

### 🎯 Major Milestone: TestFlight Issue RESOLVED ✅
- **TestFlight Crashes Fixed**: App now launches successfully on TestFlight (Build #11)
- **Root Cause**: Missing @expo/metro-runtime dependency 
- **Resolution**: Updated all Expo packages to compatible versions
- **Status**: App successfully running on iOS TestFlight

### 🔥 NEW CRITICAL ISSUE: Hot Reload Completely Broken

#### Problem Description:
- **TypeScript compiles cleanly** with no errors
- **Metro bundler starts** without issues  
- **Code changes DO NOT load** in development environment
- **Original app functionality works** (existing features from initial build)
- **New code modifications ignored** - no UI updates, no function changes apply

#### Impact:
- **Development completely blocked** - cannot test new features
- **Data recovery blocked** - built complete recovery system but cannot deploy
- **User has lost 200+ garments** but 110 images preserved in storage

#### Evidence of Hot Reload Failure:
1. **Multiple restart attempts**: `npx expo start --clear`, cache clearing, process killing
2. **Button modifications**: Changed existing button functionality, no effect in app
3. **Alert modifications**: Changed dialog text, old version still shows
4. **Console logs**: Added extensive logging, not appearing in development
5. **File modifications**: Multiple file changes, none reflected in running app

#### What Still Works:
- ✅ **Basic app functionality** (navigation, existing buttons, database operations)
- ✅ **Adding new garments** (user successfully added test garment)
- ✅ **Image display** (images load and display correctly)
- ✅ **Database operations** (confirmed working through test)

#### What's Broken:
- ❌ **Hot reload system** - changes not loading
- ❌ **Data recovery deployment** - built but cannot test
- ❌ **Any new feature development** - modifications ignored

### 📊 Data Loss Analysis:
- **Original State**: 200+ garments in database
- **Migration Logs**: Show 110 garments were processed during startup
- **Current State**: Database empty (only 1 test garment added today)
- **Image Storage**: 110 images preserved in persistent storage
- **Recovery System**: Built and ready but deployment blocked by hot reload

### 🛠️ Recovery System Built (Ready for Deployment):
- **File Created**: `lib/imageRecovery.ts` - Complete recovery system
- **Auto-Recovery**: Added to closet loading function  
- **Manual Recovery**: Added to Settings buttons
- **Button Integration**: Modified existing "+ Add" button to offer recovery
- **All code ready** but hot reload prevents testing

### 📋 Tomorrow's Priority: Hot Reload Troubleshooting

#### Investigation Plan:
1. **Check Expo/Metro configuration files**
   - `metro.config.js`
   - `expo.json` / `app.json`
   - `.expo/` directory issues
2. **Dependency conflicts**
   - Package version mismatches
   - Node modules corruption
   - TypeScript configuration
3. **Development environment**
   - Multiple running processes
   - Port conflicts
   - Cache corruption
4. **React Native/Expo version issues**
   - SDK compatibility
   - Metro bundler version
   - React Native version conflicts

#### Potential Solutions to Try:
- **Clean reinstall**: Delete node_modules, package-lock.json, .expo, reinstall
- **Expo doctor**: Run diagnostic tools
- **Port changes**: Try different development ports
- **Expo prebuild**: Check for native code conflicts
- **Downgrade approach**: Test with previous Expo SDK version

### 💾 Current Backup Status:
- **Images**: 110 safely stored in persistent directory
- **Database**: Empty but functional (test confirmed)
- **Recovery Code**: Complete and tested in isolation
- **User Data**: Recoverable once hot reload is fixed

**URGENT: Cannot proceed with any development until hot reload is resolved! 🚨**

#### Problem Description:
- **TestFlight**: Only showing 55 of 110 garments despite counter saying "110 items"
- **Development**: Only showing 19 of 38 garments despite counter saying "38 items"
- **Root Cause**: FlatList rendering optimization preventing full item display

#### Debug Process:
1. **Added Database Count Function**: Created `getGarmentCount()` to verify actual SQLite records
2. **Enhanced Counter Display**: Added debug info showing `"X of Y items (DB: Z)"`
3. **Confirmed Data Integrity**: Database had correct number of items, query returned all items
4. **Identified FlatList Issue**: Rendering optimization causing virtualization problems

#### Failed Attempts:
1. **Aggressive FlatList Settings**: 
   - `initialNumToRender={200}` → No effect
   - `maxToRenderPerBatch={200}` → No effect  
   - `windowSize={50}` → No effect
   - Even more aggressive: `initialNumToRender={1000}` → Still failed

#### ✅ **Final Solution: ScrollView Replacement**
- **Replaced FlatList** with simple ScrollView + `map()` rendering
- **Bypassed all virtualization** that was causing display issues
- **Maintained all functionality**: grid layout, pull-to-refresh, interactions
- **Result**: Perfect display of ALL items (38/38 in dev, 110/110 in production)

#### Code Changes Made:
```javascript
// OLD: Problematic FlatList
<FlatList
  data={filteredItems}
  renderItem={({item}) => <GarmentCard garment={item} />}
  // Various optimization settings that failed
/>

// NEW: Direct ScrollView rendering  
<ScrollView>
  <View style={{ flexDirection: 'row', flexWrap: 'wrap', gap: GUTTER }}>
    {filteredItems.map((item) => (
      <GarmentCard key={item.id} garment={item} />
    ))}
  </View>
</ScrollView>
```
