## ðŸ“Œ Project: **Closy â€” Your Digital Wardrobe**

### Vision
Closy helps users digitize their wardrobe, track usage, and get smart outfit suggestions that adapt to weather, dress codes, and personal taste. The app aims to reduce friction in daily outfit decisions and eventually recommend **what to wear, what to clean, and what to buy next**.

---

## âœ… Current Status
- Expo React Native app, upgraded to SDK 54.
- Local SQLite database for garments, wear history, and suggestions.
- **Core Features Working**:
  - Add garments with photo + metadata (type, colors, warmth, dress codes, dirty/clean).
  - Today screen with **3 outfit suggestions** (weather + dress code aware).
  - Shuffle per-slot and log outfits as worn.
  - Closet search/filter (by type, dress code, dirty).
  - Full edit flow (long-press â†’ update/delete).
  - Internal TestFlight setup (Apple Developer account ready).

---

## ðŸ§  Suggestion Algorithm (v1.0)
Inputs:
- Garment metadata (type, colors, warmth, dress codes, water resistance).
- Weather (temperature, rain %, wind).
- User mode (Casual, Smart Casual, Business, Sport).
- History (last worn, wear count).

Rules:
- Filter by dress code & clean status.
- Match warmth to weather.
- Enforce rain â†’ waterproof shoes/jackets.
- Simple color rules (neutrals pair with anything, avoid clashing).
- Rotate items for variety.

Output:
- 3 distinct outfits with per-slot shuffle.
- Items marked worn â†’ update history, mark dirty.

### 3. Auto Color Extraction
Detect dominant colors from garment photos.

### 4. Expanded Palette + Eyedropper
Add ~60 swatches + enable eyedropper on garment image.

### 6. Background Removal
Local soften/blur by default; optional cloud cutout (remove.bg, Replicate).

### 7. "Why This Outfit?" Explainer
One-line rationale under each suggestion card.

### 8. Learning From Interactions

### 9. Favorites & History
Save outfits and view timeline of worn items.

### 10. Backup & Export
Zip DB + images â†’ Export/Import from Files app.
